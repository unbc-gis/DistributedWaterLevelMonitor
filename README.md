# The Project
This project is being developed as part of a collaboration between the the UNBC GIS Lab and the BC Ministry of Forests Lands and Natural Resourses. The purpose of this project is to develop a low cost distributed sensor network for monitoring water levels and flood events across the province. 

The individual stations communicate via RockBLOCK satillite modems using the Iridium constellation, and are built using Arduino microcontrollers. By leveraging satellite communication, and low power monitoring tools, it is made practical to deploy sensors in locations without existing cellular or radio infrastructure, and where it may be expensive for crews to access on a regular basis.

By placing all the data into a central database, there are options opened for correlating measurements across watersheds, and viewing the same watercourse at different points.

## The Station
The station is built using an Arduino Microcontroller (original prototype was Arduino Micro, however Arduino Mega is the recommeneded board as it contains sufficent storage space for SD card Library for more frequent logging).

The station makes use of the following sesors. 
* MaxBotix MB7052-100 Ultrasonic Range Finder for water level monitoring
* Adafruit DS18b20 for water temperature monitoring
* Adafruit BME280 for weather monitoring (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)

Data transmission: RockBLOCK 19354
Data Logging: Adafuit Micro-SD Breakout+
Real time Clock: PCF 8523
Power is provided by a lead-acid car battery and a 6-36v to 5v voltage regulator

The station is constructed inside of a reusable sealing food container, all components were hot glued to the lid of the container and then cables for external sensors were run through holes and sealed with silicon.

The water level sensor was attached to a 1x4, which was in tern screwed to the side of a bridge holding it at a steady position above the water.

## The Webserver
  The webserver is built using Python Flask and PostgreSQL, and is designed to provide an easy to use view of the data collected by the sensors.

The webserver exposes the following endpoints
 * http://<domain>/rockblock this is the URL used to add data, and should only be called by the RockBlock api, it takes the following information: imei, momsn, transmit_time, iridium_latitude, iridium_longitude, iridum_cep, payload 
  * http://<domain>/deployments returns a JSON list of all current and past deployments with their locations and dates of use
  * http://<domain>/resutls?deployment=<id> Returns a JSON list of all results recorded by deployment id, the deployment id can be determined from http://<domain>/deployments
  * http://<domain>/graph?deployment=<id> Returns a graphical representation of results
  * still under development is a map that will show all deployments, clicking on pins in the map will allow linking to the graph page for the deployment in question.
